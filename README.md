# Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time IoT anomaly detection and mitigation solution in a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment. 
The solution utilizes In-band Network telemetry (INT) data to address the challenges posed by vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including their limited capabilities and susceptibility to attacks.

# Features

- Real-time Anomaly Detection: Utilizes INT data to detect IoT attacks in real-time, providing quick response to potential threats.

- Low Detection Delay: The proposed approach significantly reduces detection delay compared to previous Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) research, ensuring timely detection and mitigation.

- High Detection Accuracy: Achieves high detection accuracy, enhancing the security posture of IoT devices within the network.
